### Personal Profile
I am a motivated, responsible and approachable individual with a strong work ethics and consistently maintained high level of integrity at all levels, built upon a career in IT. After a period of redundancy due to COVID-19 and relocation, I decided on further improving and learning more in the area of technology, and began re-training with TechTalent’s Academy in AWS-reStart program. I plan to take my improved skill in Cloud Computing (AWS), Linux, Networking, Security, Python, JavaScript, Database to market, and actively seeking employment at the entry level to coincide with my study.
